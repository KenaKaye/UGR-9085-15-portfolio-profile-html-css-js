                        <p>This project is a full-stack web application designed for efficient folder management. The back-end is built using Java with the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure. The front-end, developed using React.js, ensures a dynamic and interactive user experience. The application includes a secure user authentication system with features such as login, registration, and role-based access control. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for folder and file management, allowing users to organize their digital content seamlessly. Additionally, the project boasts a responsive design implemented with Bootstrap, ensuring accessibility across various devices and screen sizes. The integration of RESTful APIs facilitates smooth communication between the front-end and back-end, while GitHub was utilized for version control to manage code changes effectively during development.</p>

                        <h3>Project 4: KiloEats</h3>
                        <p>KiloEats is an affordable and efficient food delivery platform designed specifically for Addis Ababa University (AAU) students residing in the 4, 5, and 6 Kilo campuses. Built with Django, the platform connects students with local restaurants offering budget-friendly meals, featuring a user-friendly interface, real-time order tracking, and secure TeleBirr payment integration. By addressing challenges such as high delivery costs, limited affordable meal options, and time constraints, KiloEats supports both students and local eateries. Key features include live menu updates, optimized delivery routes, a feedback system for service quality improvement, and a custom dashboard for restaurants to manage menus and prices. Developed with open-source technologies, it utilizes React.js for a responsive frontend, Nest.js for backend operations, and MongoDB for scalable data management. The project, structured using the Waterfall methodology, spans three months and emphasizes seamless user experiences, efficient delivery coordination, and strengthened ties between students and local businesses.</p>
